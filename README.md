RaspberryPi-GPIO-AutoSelect
RaspberryPi-GPIO-AutoSelect is a Python script designed to automatically select the appropriate GPIO chip for various Raspberry Pi models. This utility facilitates seamless GPIO programming, especially for SPI applications, by dynamically identifying the Raspberry Pi model in use and adjusting GPIO chip selections accordingly. It's aimed at developers seeking a model-agnostic approach to GPIO manipulation, ensuring compatibility and performance across different Raspberry Pi versions.

Features
Automatically detects the Raspberry Pi model.
Selects the corresponding GPIO chip based on the model.
Simplifies SPI programming and general GPIO tasks.
Supports Raspberry Pi 3, 4, and 5 models.

Functionality
This script includes a demonstration feature where GPIO 22 is used as an output pin that is toggled to create a pulsing effect. Additionally, several other GPIO pins (17, 18, 23, and 27) are configured as inputs with pull-up resistors enabled. This setup serves as an example of how to use the script for both input and output GPIO tasks on a Raspberry Pi.

Testing GPIO Outputs and Inputs
The main program includes a loop that toggles GPIO 22, effectively turning it on and off at a specified interval (RESET_TIME), demonstrating how to control an output pin. This can be useful for tasks such as blinking an LED, triggering relays, or any other digital output tasks.

For input pins, the script configures GPIO 17, 18, 23, and 27 as inputs with pull-up resistors. This configuration is commonly used when dealing with switches, buttons, or any sensors that require a pull-up resistor to ensure a known state when the input is not actively driven.

To see this functionality in action, simply run the script on your Raspberry Pi. Ensure you have connected appropriate peripherals (like LEDs for output pins and buttons for input pins) to observe the behavior.

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/ClaudiusVi/RaspberryPi-GPIO-AutoSelect.git
Usage
To use the utility in your project, import the script and initialize your GPIO tasks as needed. The script will automatically select the correct GPIO chip:

python
Copy code
from RaspberryPi-GPIO-AutoSelect import auto_select_gpio_chip

# Initialize and use GPIO pins as required
